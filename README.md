Reading CSV Files: I used the pd.read_csv() function from the Pandas library to read CSV files. The files you read include "school_summary.csv" and potentially other files like "students_complete.csv" and "schools_complete.csv". These files contain data related to schools, students, and their performance.

Data Analysis and Manipulation: I performed various data analysis and manipulation tasks using Pandas DataFrame operations. These tasks involved grouping and aggregating data, calculating summary statistics, sorting values, and selecting specific rows or columns of interest.

School Performance Analysis: I analyzed school performance by calculating average scores, passing rates, and overall passing rates for math and reading subjects. I also identified the top-performing schools based on overall passing rates and displayed the results.

School Type Analysis: I grouped the data by school type (e.g., district or charter) and calculated average scores, passing rates, and overall passing rates based on school type. You displayed the results to compare the performance of different school types.

Saving Results: I saved the analysis results as CSV files using the to_csv() method. This allowed me to store the summarized data for future reference or further analysis.

Overall, the Pandas challenge involved loading and analyzing data from CSV files, performing calculations and aggregations, and generating summary statistics and reports.
